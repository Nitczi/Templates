Sharing some practing of HTML and CSS. I just finished the SupersimpleDev Youtube course(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) and I think that was a good experience, the only thing I need to pay is for the certificate, but the knowledge remains.

I'm trying to replicate some other sites(as shown in the course) like: Twitter, Youtube, etc.
